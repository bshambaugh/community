#### Footnotes:

1. TODO: Needs discussion (notes from Christopher):
    - Needs cryptographer review
    - More of a Data Verification item
    - Perhaps needs to be split into 2 work items
    - Should this be moved to another standards body or group?
    - Can W3C TAG contribute?
2. TODO: W3C CCG Process is blocking closing process of other work items:
   - Needs documentation for "Close of Work Item" & "Community Report" processes
   - Needs spectext, close process

## Completed Work Items 

TODO: Where can we find the others?

### Specifications

The following specifications were incubated in this group and are now undergoing international standardization:

- [Verifiable Claims Use Cases 1.0](https://w3c.github.io/vc-use-cases/) - Use Cases for claims that are cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and automatically verifiable
- [Verifiable Claims Data Model 1.0](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) - A standard mechanism for expressing items such as driver's licenses, employee ID cards, proofs of age, and other sorts of claims in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and automatically verifiable.

### Reports

- [Verifiable Credentials Lifecycle](https://goo.gl/pBKL08) - This report was incubated in this group and has been integrated into the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/). Closed 2018-01-16
